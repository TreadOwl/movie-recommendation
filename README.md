# movie-recommendation

Created a ’Movie Recommendation System’ which gives recommendations based on 3 different parameters. Firstly, gives a list of movies based on critical ratings and user reviews. Otherwise, curates a list of movies based on their description/synopsis or, curates a list of movies based on their cast and keywords, configuring the similarities between them to give better personalized recommendations.
